/**
 * IndexedDB-backed cache for the per-mission event history.
 *
 * Why this exists: the `/api/control/missions/<id>/events` endpoint is the
 * single slowest call on the control page — a mission with a few hundred
 * tool-heavy events can take 20+ seconds to come back and weigh in at over a
 * megabyte. On a fresh load there's nothing to do but wait, but on reopen we
 * already know what most of those events look like.
 *
 * What this stores: a capped tail of the raw `StoredEvent` rows for each
 * mission (newest `MAX_CACHED_EVENTS`), plus the server's last reported
 * `maxSequence` / `totalEvents`. On reopen, the consumer can render the
 * cached events immediately and then issue a small `since_seq` request for
 * just the delta — turning a 20-second wait into a near-instant repaint plus
 * a sub-second tail fetch.
 *
 * Why IDB over localStorage: a long mission's event tail can exceed 1 MB
 * once `tool_result` payloads are included. localStorage's 5–10 MB shared
 * budget runs out fast across multiple missions and writes block the main
 * thread; IDB writes are async and per-mission storage is naturally
 * bounded by the cap.
