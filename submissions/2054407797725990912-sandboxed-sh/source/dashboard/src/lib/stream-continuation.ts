/**
 * Streaming-delta continuation detection.
 *
 * Backends (codex, grok, anthropic) emit incremental text/thinking deltas as
 * the model produces tokens. We consolidate consecutive deltas of the same
 * stream into one chat bubble. The naive rule — strict prefix equality —
 * miscategorises plenty of real-world payloads as "new thoughts" because
 * the backends occasionally re-emit a buffer with trailing whitespace
 * trimmed, with a punctuation character added, or with one extra token
 * appended. Each false-negative gets persisted as a fresh chat item and
 * blows up DOM + memory (the "NoNo newNo new CI…" pattern visible on
 * mission `3a902278`).
 *
 * Rules implemented here (all evaluated in `isStreamContinuation`):
 *   1. If either side is empty, treat as a continuation.
 *   2. Strict prefix in either direction → continuation.
 *   3. Strip trailing whitespace + a fixed punctuation set, retest prefix.
 *   4. Tail-tolerance: if the shorter side equals the longer side up to
 *      `TAIL_TOLERANCE` trailing chars, treat as continuation (handles
 *      "X" → "X." → "X. " drift).
 *
 * Pure + dependency-free so it can be unit-tested cheaply and shipped to
 * the iOS app via the same logic on the Swift side (mirrored there in a
 * follow-up commit).
