# Sandboxed.sh Scripts

Small helper scripts for local development and packaging.

## Available Scripts

### smoke_harnesses_dev.sh
Unified dev smoke gate for model-routing and mission streaming.

Runs:
- `proxy_smoke.py` against `/v1/models` and `/v1/chat/completions`
- `mission_stream_smoke.py` across selected harness backends

Use `--help` for all options, including backend-specific model overrides and expected model assertions.

### assistant_mcp_smoke.sh
Smoke test for the Hermes assistant MCP bridge. It checks
`/api/system/components` for `assistant_mcp`, initializes `assistant-mcp`, calls
`list_active_missions`, and validates the JSON-RPC responses. Use
`--require-hermes-runtime` after installing the external Hermes service.

Example:
- `scripts/assistant_mcp_smoke.sh --base-url https://agent-backend-dev.thomas.md`
- `scripts/assistant_mcp_smoke.sh --base-url https://agent-backend-dev.thomas.md --require-hermes-runtime`

The second command is the cutover gate. It should fail until
`hermes-assistant-dev.service` is installed, active, and reported as
`hermes_assistant` with status `ok` from `/api/system/components`.

### harness_contract_tests.sh
Runs a curated set of fast cross-harness contract tests that guard event-conversion invariants and OpenCode SSE parsing behavior.
Used by CI job `harness-contract`.

### proxy_smoke.py
Smoke test for the OpenAI-compatible proxy routes:
- `GET /v1/models`
- `POST /v1/chat/completions` (streaming, and optional non-streaming)

### mission_stream_smoke.py
Mission API streaming smoke test across harnesses (`claudecode`, `opencode`, `codex` by default).

Validates:
- streaming thinking/text/tool events
- queued-message behavior
- assistant model metadata (with optional per-backend expectations)

For history loading changes, run this against the dev deployment and then
inspect the created mission with `/api/control/missions/:id/snapshot` and
`/events?view=history`: the snapshot should contain the first-paint payload and
`/events` should handle pagination and delta catch-up.

### install_desktop.sh
Installs desktop automation dependencies on the host (used by the desktop MCP).

### generate_ios_icons.js
Generates iOS app icons for the SwiftUI dashboard.

### setup_android_release_secrets.sh
Generates an Android release signing keystore, stores a local backup under
`android_dashboard/keys/`, and uploads the matching GitHub Actions secrets with
`gh secret set`.

### validate_skill_isolation.sh
Validates strong workspace skill isolation on the server (checks OpenCode env, global skill dirs, and latest mission skills).

### mission_debug_bundle.sh
Collects a mission-focused diagnostic bundle from control API endpoints (mission snapshot, events, tree, automations, progress, OpenCode diagnostics) and outputs a `.tar.gz` archive for triage.

### telegram_user_smoke.py
Authenticates a real Telegram user account via Telethon and helps test a bot from
the client side.

Setup:
- Create API credentials on `https://my.telegram.org`
- Export `TELEGRAM_API_ID`, `TELEGRAM_API_HASH`, and `TELEGRAM_PHONE`
- Install Telethon: `python3 -m pip install telethon`

Example:
- `python3 scripts/telegram_user_smoke.py --chat -1001730152948 --send "@ana_lfgbot ping" --print-history`
